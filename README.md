# ðŸŒ Global Broadcast Network (GBN) â€” Prototype Workspace

**A decentralized, censorship-resistant video creation, publishing, and distribution platform â€” designed so truth can travel faster than it can be suppressed.**

> *"The internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it."*
> â€” John Gilmore

## âš ï¸ Project Status

This repository is an **active prototype** (`gbn-proto`) for validating core architecture and security assumptions.

- âœ… Core Rust workspace and crate boundaries are in place
- âœ… Integration test scaffolding exists for metadata stripping, multipath reassembly, tamper detection, and end-to-end pipeline tests
- ðŸš§ CLI orchestration commands are partially implemented (see `crates/proto-cli/src/main.rs`)
- ðŸš§ Not production-ready; APIs and protocols are expected to evolve during prototyping

If you are looking for full system design docs (requirements, architecture, security), see [`../../docs/`](../../docs/).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.77+
- FFmpeg 6.0+
- (Optional for infra simulation) AWS CLI + Docker

### 1) Build the workspace

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

### 2) Run tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### 3) Add local test videos (for media pipeline tests)

Place `.mp4` files in [`test-vectors/`](./test-vectors/) (this directory is gitignored).

See [`test-vectors/README.md`](./test-vectors/README.md) for expected files and guidance.

### 4) (Optional) AWS phase infrastructure

For EC2-based prototype runs and teardown, see [`infra/README-infra.md`](./infra/README-infra.md).

## Vision & Mission

In many countries, a journalist who records police violence, corruption, or protests faces an impossible choice: **publish and be identified, or stay silent and stay safe**.

Existing options leave major gaps:
- **Mainstream platforms** can remove content centrally and log subpoenaable metadata.
- **Tor + generic file sharing** protects uploader routing but does not provide an integrated publisher trust + distribution pipeline.
- **VPNs** shift trust to the VPN operator.

The **Global Broadcast Network** aims to provide a complete, end-to-end pipeline â€” from capture to playback â€” such that no single point of failure can trivially identify creators or suppress distribution.

### Design Principles

| Principle | What It Means In Practice |
|---|---|
| ðŸ”’ **Privacy by Default** | End-to-end encryption and local metadata sanitization before transmission |
| ðŸŒ **Resilience over Efficiency** | Erasure-coded distribution across geographically diverse nodes |
| âš–ï¸ **Legal Responsibility at the Edges** | Editorial/legal responsibility is with Publishers and Content Providers |
| ðŸ§¬ **Adaptive to Adversaries** | Pluggable transport strategy evolves against censorship techniques |
| ðŸ›¡ï¸ **Sovereign Updates** | Supply-chain hardening via reproducible builds and multi-party governance (see [GBN-SEC-007](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-007-Software-Supply-Chain.md)) |

## Prototyping Phases

### Phase 1 â€” Media Creation Network & reconstruction
ðŸ“„ Plan: [`../../docs/prototyping/GBN-PROTO-001-Phase1-Media-Creation.md`](../../docs/prototyping/GBN-PROTO-001-Phase1-Media-Creation.md)

### Phase 2 â€” Publishing & distributed storage
ðŸ“„ Plan: [`../../docs/prototyping/GBN-PROTO-002-Phase2-Publishing-Storage.md`](../../docs/prototyping/GBN-PROTO-002-Phase2-Publishing-Storage.md)

### Phase 3 â€” Overlay broadcast network & playback
ðŸ“„ Plan: [`../../docs/prototyping/GBN-PROTO-003-Phase3-Broadcast-Playback.md`](../../docs/prototyping/GBN-PROTO-003-Phase3-Broadcast-Playback.md)

## Security Model (Summary)

GBN uses a **Zero-Knowledge Transit** design goal: intermediate nodes should know only what is necessary for forwarding.

Detailed security docs:
- [GBN-SEC-001 â€” Media Creation Network](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-001-Media-Creation-Network.md)
- [GBN-SEC-002 â€” Media Publishing](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-002-Media-Publishing.md)
- [GBN-SEC-003 â€” Global Distributed Storage](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-003-Global-Distributed-Storage.md)
- [GBN-SEC-004 â€” Video Content Providers](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-004-Video-Content-Providers.md)
- [GBN-SEC-005 â€” Video Playback App](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-005-Video-Playback-App.md)
- [GBN-SEC-006 â€” Broadcast Network](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-006-Broadcast-Network.md)
- [GBN-SEC-007 â€” Software Supply Chain](../../docs/security/GBN-SEC-007-Software-Supply-Chain.md)

### Important limitations

As documented in the security files, the system **does not fully mitigate**:
- endpoint compromise (malware/physical seizure)
- global passive adversary traffic correlation (partially mitigated)
- complete internet shutdown/physical disconnection events
